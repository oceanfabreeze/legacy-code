## enhanced-zabbix-housekeeping
Created this to cleanup history data from the Zabbix servers and proxies. One of the many flaws of older Zabbix running in Cerner environments is that the housekeeper service stinks sometimes. It can only delete so much before it gives up and times out. Especially with the resources our system has. This SQL will go out and make sure that the retention policy you set is properly followed. Default is 90 day drilled down history, 1 year trends history. This was a work in progress that was never fully finished before I left Cerner for the first time. A stopgap solution. 

## lazymenu
A menu created to assist newer backend System Engineers with quick tasks. Also something I was working on, but abandoned when I left Cerner. 

## mysql-filesystem-check
```Created this to check the MySQL filesystem on Zabbix nodes. If the filesystem gets over the set threshold, it sends an email to the Zabbix Admin defined in the script. I probably could've used Zabbix to do this e-mail notification.....but heck I still haven't gone through the email configuration for our Zabbix instance and most of the email's it sends are completely useless. So I have them filter out to a separate folder and wouldn't see the email about this filesystem needing cleaned up.``` (As I wrote in 2019....)

To install this as a daily cronjob. Copy script to /etc/cron.daily/ using commands below.

```bash
wget -P /etc/cron.daily https://raw.github.cerner.com/TF054451/bashyboi/master/mysql-filesystem-check/zabbixmysqlcheck
chmod +x /etc/cron.daily/zabbixmysqlcheck

#use vi to edit the $ZABBIXADMIN field in the script to set your own email.
vi /etc/cron.daily/zabbixmysqlcheck
```
